# Security Policy
Thank you for helping us keep our MCP servers secure.

The **reference servers** in this repo are maintained by [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/) as part of the Model Context Protocol project.

The security of our systems and user data is Anthropic's top priority. We appreciate the work of security researchers acting in good faith in identifying and reporting potential vulnerabilities.

## Important Notice

The servers in this repository are **reference implementations** intended to demonstrate MCP features and SDK usage. They serve as educational examples for developers building their own MCP servers, not as production-ready solutions.

**Bug bounties are not awarded for security vulnerabilities found in these reference servers.** Our bug bounty program applies exclusively to the [MCP SDKs](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol) maintained by Anthropic. If you discover a vulnerability in an MCP SDK that is maintained by Anthropic, please report it through our vulnerability disclosure program below.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Program

Our Vulnerability Program guidelines are defined on our [HackerOne program page](https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp). We ask that any validated vulnerability in this functionality be reported through the [submission form](https://hackerone.com/anthropic-vdp/reports/new?type=team&report_type=vulnerability).
